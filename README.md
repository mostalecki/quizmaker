# quizmaker
Quizmaker is a part of a IV semester group side-project that allows you to create multiple choice text-quizzes and save them to json files, or load existing quizzes and edit them. It's designed to be used with [this client](https://github.com/the2ndpartisnotcreatedyet.com) which is the second part of this project.\
It was built according to MVP design pattern using Windows Forms.\

This is a sample json data containing a quiz with 2 questions, 4 answers each:
```json
{
    "title": "Sample quiz",
    "questions": [{
        "text": "What's the capital of Thailand?",
        "answers": ["Hanoi", "Bangkok", "Phnom Penh", "Singapore"],
        "isCorrect": [false, true, false, false],
        "points": 5
    }, {
        "text": "Which of the following astronauts have walked the moon?",
        "answers": ["Buzz Aldrin", "Chris Hadfield", "Yuri Gagarin", "Neil Armstrong"],
        "isCorrect": [true, false, false, true],
        "points": 1
    }],
    "totalPoints": 6
}
```

Quizmaker uses [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) to perform serialization and deserialization.
