# quizmaker
Quizmaker is a part of a IV semester group side-project. It allows you to create multiple choice text-quizzes and save them as json files, or load existing quizzes and edit them. It's designed to be used with [this client](https://github.com/dawpolak/quiz-client) which is the second part of this project.\
It was built using Windows Forms, according to MVP design pattern.\
